## Why Woven Canvas?

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Fully Customizable" icon="lucide:puzzle">
    Replace any built-in block with your own Vue component. Create custom tools, menus, and interactions that fit your exact needs.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Built for Vue" icon="lucide:code">
    First-class Vue 3 integration with reactive composables. Use `useComponent`, `useQuery`, and `useSingleton` to build reactive UI.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Plugin Architecture" icon="lucide:layers">
    Extend the editor with plugins that add components, systems, keybinds, and more. Compose functionality from reusable pieces.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Multiplayer Ready" icon="lucide:users">
    Built-in support for real-time collaboration with conflict resolution, presence awareness, and offline-first architecture.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Quick Example

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { WovenCanvas } from '@woven-canvas/vue'
import '@woven-canvas/vue/style.css'
</script>

<template>
  <WovenCanvas style="width: 100vw; height: 100vh" />
</template>
```

That's it! You now have a fully functional infinite canvas with:
- Pan and zoom controls
- Selection and multi-select
- Built-in shapes, text, images, pen, and arrows
- Undo/redo support

## Make It Yours

The real power of Woven Canvas is customization. Override any block with your own component:

```vue
<template>
  <WovenCanvas>
    <!-- Replace the default sticky note with your own -->
    <template #block:sticky-note="{ entityId, block }">
      <MyCustomStickyNote :entity-id="entityId" :block="block" />
    </template>

    <!-- Add a completely new block type -->
    <template #block:kanban-card="{ entityId, block }">
      <KanbanCard :entity-id="entityId" :block="block" />
    </template>
  </WovenCanvas>
</template>
```
